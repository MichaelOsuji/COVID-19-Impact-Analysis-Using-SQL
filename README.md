# COVID-19-Impact-Analysis

This is a code containing the exploratory analysis of COVID-19 dataset from World Health Organization (WHO). The SQL code contains the following: 


## Questions interested in answering
- Continents with the highest death count
- Countries with the highest percentage of population infected
- Global number of cases of infected individuals.


## Steps utilized
- Utilized the JOINS functions to combine the rows from the vaccinated table to the deaths table 
- Aggregate functions applied to perform calculations relating to global cases  
- CTE was applied in the code to determine the percentage of vaccinated individuals
- Temp tables were also used to gain in-depth knowledge on the use of Temp tables


## Key Insights Derived
- Europe and Asia had the most cases of deaths from the virus
- The recovery rate from the virus was really good as most infected individuals recovered to full health
- According to countries, Austria had the most number of infected population. 


After querying of the dataset, the information obtained were visualized on the [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/michael.osuji/vizzes) dashboard
